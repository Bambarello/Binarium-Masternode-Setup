Masternode VPS Setup Guide
Please use this guide for setting up our masternodes using a VPS – We recommend Vultr or DigitalOcean. Please set a VPS before continuing.

WALLET SIDE
Step 1.Open wallet and create a new receiving address with Label [masternode01]. Copy address provided in window and close.
Step 2.Click send and paste new receiving address into address field. Label of [masternode01] will appear once pasted, then enter amount of 10,000 XRH and send. This will make a payment to yourself.
Step 3. Allow payment to yourself to confirm, once confirmed - Open debug console (tools>debug console) and then type masternode genkey and hit enter. The type masternode outputs and hit enter. Save these two for later.

SERVER SIDE
Step 1. Open Putty and log into your server using the VPS IP.
Step 2. Terminal will open upon launch, log in using “root” and password given in VPS.
Step 3. Paste each one separately and hit enter 

fallocate -l 3G /swapfile
chmod 600 /swapfile
mkswap /swapfile
swapon /swapfile
echo -e "/swapfile none swap sw 0 0 \n" >> /etc/fstab 

Step 3. Paste each one separately and hit enter 

git clone https://github.com/Rheniumnetwork/Rhenium Rhenium
cd Rhenium
sudo apt-get install -y pkg-config
sudo apt-get -y install build-essential autoconf automake libtool libboost-all-dev libgmp-dev libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev git
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-dev
sudo chmod +x share/genbuild.sh
sudo chmod +x autogen.sh
sudo chmod 755 src/leveldb/build_detect_platform
sudo ./autogen.sh
sudo ./configure
sudo make (This will take time)

Step 4. Paste each one separately and hit enter

cd src
./Rheniumd -daemon (It will give you an rpc username and rpc password - save these 2 lines it gives you to a notepad for now)
sudo nano ~/.Rhenium/Rhenium.conf (It will open a nano pad)
paste the 2 lines that you have saved on notepad and paste this directly underneath

listen=1
server=1
daemon=1
logtimestamps=1
maxconnections=256
masternode=1
externalip=[YOUR VPS IP]
bind=[YOUR VPS IP]
masternodeaddr=[YOUR VPS IP:5110]
masternodeprivkey=[YOUR MASTERNODE GENKEY]

Then save+exit (CTRL + X then ENTER)

Step 6. Paste each one separately and hit enter

./Rheniumd -daemon (Server will start)
./Rhenium-cli getinfo (Provides server info)
Server side is now complete. Close putty.

WALLET SIDE
Step 1. Go to tools > Open Masternode Configuration File (open with notepad if prompted)
Step 2. Start new line below examples. Type these in following order exactly with your own relevant details.
[YOUR RECEIVING LABEL] [VPS IP:5110] [MASTERNODE GEN KEY] [MASTERNODE OUTPUT TX] 
Ensure there is a space between each. See example above in Masternode configuration file for further guidance.
Step 3. Save file and close wallet
Step 4.Restart wallet, wait for it to fully sync then go to masternodes tab. You will see your “MISSING” masternode – right click “START ALIAS”.

Your masternode is now enabled!
